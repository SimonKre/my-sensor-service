# my-sensor-service
An ecosystem consisting of a java web application and a variety of IoT sensors managed on a personal account.

Its power lies in the simplicity of adding new sensors, their types, types of data, and notifications when a defined event occurs.

A sensor is a device, usually connected to the Internet through Wifi, that can measure various types and amount of data.
Sensor types and data they can provide, can be defined in the administrative panel - they are not hardcoded.

On your user account, you can view the data, add new sensors as well as alerts triggered in case of exceeding the set values.

The project is currently configured to be deployed on Google App Engine and uses technologies such as:
Java 8, Spring (IoC, Security, Data), Hibernate, Maven etc.
