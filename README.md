# my-sensor-service
Service for managing and logging data from IoT sensors.

A sensor is a device, usually connected to the Internet through Wifi, that can measure various types and amount of data.
Sensor types and data that they can provide, can be defined in the administrative panel - they are not hardcoded.

On your user account, you can view the data, add new sensors as well as alerts triggered in case of exceeding the set values.
